## Flat's Technology

The [Flat platform](https://flat.io) is built on modern and standard web technologies and is the result of several years of R&D. Flat's music engraving technology uses standard HTML5 (SVG) and JavaScript that works with any web browser including tablets and smartphones (your visitors and users won't need any app, plugin, or Flash).

Many people and companies have requested us to use our great technology and beautiful music engraving in their projects, apps, software, websites, and blogs. That's why we decided it make it available via an embeddable `<iframe>`:

* In a few click or lines or code, you get interactive sheet music ready to use on your website.
* You can easily create and edit music notation and TABs with our web editor [Flat](https://flat.io) and display them in no time on any web page.
* You can also [embed our editor directly in your site](javascript-editor.html), and let your users or visitors create and edit MusicXML files.
* We manage the hosting, the maintenance and of course the automatic updates and improvements with no modifications required on your end!
